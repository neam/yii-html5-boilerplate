# Yii HTML5 Boilerplate integration

This is a fork from the famous HTML5 Boilerplate, as integrated in a Yii template. A very basic integration that does little more than provide an empty Yii theme skeleton that renders the basic menu and content from the original webapp classic theme.

## Google Analytics

You may set the Google Analytics ID as an application parameter in your Yii config, and the snippet will render.

Example:

    return array(
        ...
        'params' => array(
    		...
            'google-analytics-site-id'      => 'UA-XXXXX-X',
	    	...
        )
    )
